# Frontend Mentor - Recipe page

Challenge number four. Built with HTML and CSS. Flexbox heavily involved<br>
Played around with responsive font sizes, so that the headers resize according to<br>
screen size. There is also a simple media query thrown in for smaller screen sizes<br>
to remove the padding on the body. This is to keep the page from squeezing too much.
